# 06 Experimental Data

This folder contains experimental data generated during the research, which are crucial for the phenotypic and genetic analyses described in the paper. The data includes results from various assays such as growth curves, motility tests, resistance profiling, and more. These datasets provide insights into the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of the strains under study.

## Data Files

The following files are included in this folder:

### 1. **Phenotypic Assay Data**

* **`phenotypic_data_assay_growth_curve.xlsx`**: Growth performance data of bacterial strains across different time points.
* **`phenotypic_data_assay_iron_limitation.xlsx`**: Results from the iron-limitation assay, showing how bacterial growth was affected under iron-limited conditions.
* **`phenotypic_data_assay_swarming_motility.xlsx`**: Swarming motility assay data, providing measurements of bacterial motility across different strains and conditions.
* **`phenotypic_data_assay_swimming_motility.xlsx`**: Swimming motility assay results, showing the movement of bacterial strains in agar.

### 2. **Resistance Data**

* **`phenotypic_resistance_data.xlsx`**: Resistance profiles of the bacterial strains to various antibiotics.
* **`resistance_annotion.txt`**: Resistance gene annotation data, detailing the resistance genes identified in the samples.
* **`resistance_gene_0_1_matrix.txt`**: A binary matrix showing the presence (1) or absence (0) of resistance genes in each strain.

### 3. **Serotype and MLST Data**

* **`serotype-mlst_annotion.txt`**: Information on the serotype and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) of the strains.

### 4. **Virulence Data**

* **`virulence_gene_0_1_matrix.txt`**: A binary matrix indicating the presence or absence of virulence genes in each strain.

## Usage

These datasets are used for various types of analyses, such as:

* Evaluating the growth performance of different strains.
* Analyzing motility behavior (swarming, swimming) under different conditions.
* Assessing the resistance profiles and virulence gene content of the strains.

The data files can be used for further bioinformatics analyses, statistical testing, or visualization to support the conclusions drawn in the research.
